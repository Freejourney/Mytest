```

```
    git commit -m "some information about this commit"
```

##### X. add remote repository

```
    git remote add origin http:https://github.com/Freejourney/Mytest
```
In this, **origin** is the name of remote repository and it connects to the URL address


#### 3. Push changes to github

```
    git push origin master
```
In this part, **master** is your local branch, and this will be **pushed** into your default branch of your origin repository
